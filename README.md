# Multi-Taper-Spectrum-for-Speech-Emotion-Recognition

In this project, the performance of multi-taper spectral estimate is investigated relative to conventional 
single taper estimate for the application of emotion recognition fromspeech signals. 

Typically, a single taper/window helps in reducing bias of the estimate, but due to its high variance, the resulting
spectral features tend to give poor recognition performance. 

The weighted averages of the multi-tapered uncorrelated eigenspectra results in more discriminative spectral 
features, thus increasing the overall performance. 

We demonstrate that the application of six Multi-peak multi-tapers with support vector machine 
results in 81% classification accuracy on seven emotions from Berlin emotion database 
considering only spectral features, compared to 72% using conventional Hamming window method.
